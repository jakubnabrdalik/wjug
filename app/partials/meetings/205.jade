                        p Let's imagine that Spring IoC works not only inside single JVM, but also across many JVM's working on different hosts. You create and inject beans like you would normally do, but in reality they may live on different data centers on different continents. This is what Ratel gives you - a Spring like abstraction for using distributed beans. This will a live demo presenting how to use Ratel and how does it work.
