                        p Automatic memory management and garbage collection is one of the biggest advantage of JVM compared with previous platforms. But it has a price: GC overhead and pauses. When every millisecond counts this price can be too high. You can get away and not pay it by taking responsibility back into your hands.
                        p I will describe what does "off-heap" memory means for java application developer and how he can use it in order to speed his application up.
                        p The majority of this talk is live code demonstration. I will use different ways to implement off-heap data storage and will show how fast one and the same piece of code runs with each implementation. For correct benchmarking JMH is used :)
