                        h3 O prezentacji:
                        p After a brief introduction to a methodology to performance tune Java applications, the audience will guide me through the steps needed to tune an application. The application models a number of performance problems that are common in real world applications. During the session, I will introduce a number of tools designed to expose causal code paths to each specific problem.
