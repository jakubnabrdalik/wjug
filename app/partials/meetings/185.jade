                        h3 O prezentacji:
                        p A Java 8's lambdas empower us to create wonderful APIs. Javaslang lets us dive deeper into the world of functional programming by providing us with persistent data types, immutable collections and functional control structures. The results are beautiful and do just work.
                        p During this presentation we will recall Java8's downsides and explore how Javaslang's Scala-inspired features fill-in the gaps.
