            <h3>O prezentacji:</h3>
            <p>After a brief introduction to a methodology to performance tune Java applications, the audience will guide me through the steps needed to tune an application. The application models a number of performance problems that are common in real world applications. During the session, I will introduce a number of tools designed to expose causal code paths to each specific problem.</p>
