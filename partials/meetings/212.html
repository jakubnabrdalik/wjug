            <h3>O prezentacji:</h3>
            <p>Since the early days, software development has evolved a lot. Writing code used to be a long tiring activity, but now is no longer the bottleneck. However, if we see software development with a different perspective, weâ€™ll realize that there are vast opportunities for improvement, by switching to a more appropriate metaphor.</p>

            <h4>Alberto Brandolini</h4>
            <p>Alberto Brandolini is an IT Professional that gets bored doing things in the same old way. This led him into unexplored areas of Domain-Driven Design, Lean and Agile Software Development, learning and change management, where he likes to bring apparent chaotic fuzziness and a comic-like visual touch. An active consultant in software product development, he also run his company Avanscoperta.</p>
