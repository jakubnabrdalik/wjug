            <h2>Consumer Driven Contracts and Your Microservice Architecture</h2>
            <h3>Marcin Grzejszczak</h3>
            <p>Termin: 15.11.2016 godz. 18:15</p>
            <p>Lokalizacja: MIMUW, sala 3180</p>
            <h3>O prezentacji:</h3>
            <p>Consumer driven contracts (CDC) are like TDD applied to the API. It’s especially important in the world of microservices. Since it’s driven by consumers, it’s much more user friendly. Of course microservices are really cool, but most people do not take into consideration plenty of potential obstacles that should be tackled. Then instead of frequent, fully automated deploys via a delivery pipeline, you might end up in an asylum due to frequent mental breakdowns caused by production disasters.</p>
            <p>We will write a system using the CDC approach together with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud Contract verifier. I'll show you how easy it is to write applications that have a consumer driven API and that will allow a developer to speed up the time of writing his better quality software.</p>
