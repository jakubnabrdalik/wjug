            <h2>Heap, off you go</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://plumbr.eu/" target="_blank"> Nikita Salnikov-Tarnovski</a></h3>
            <p>Termin: 27.01.2015 godz. 18:00</p>
            <p>Lokalizacja: MIMUW, sala 3180</p>
            <h3>O prezentacji:</h3>
            <p>Automatic memory management and garbage collection is one of the biggest advantage of JVM compared with previous platforms. But it has a price: GC overhead and pauses. When every millisecond counts this price can be too high. You can get away and not pay it by taking responsibility back into your hands.</p>
            <p>I will describe what does "off-heap" memory means for java application developer and how he can use it in order to speed his application up.</p>
            <p>The majority of this talk is live code demonstration. I will use different ways to implement off-heap data storage and will show how fast one and the same piece of code runs with each implementation. For correct benchmarking JMH is used :)</p>
