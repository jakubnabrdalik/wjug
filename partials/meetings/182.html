            <h2>Microservices tracing with Spring Cloud and Zipkin</h2>
            <h3>Marcin Grzejszczak</h3>
            <p>Termin: 24.05.2016 godz. 18:15</p>
            <p>Lokalizacja: MIMUW, sala 3180</p>
            <h3>O prezentacji:</h3>
            <p>2015 was the year of microservices. It’s already common knowledge that creating distributed systems is not easy. It’s 2016 and it’s time to show how that complexity can be contained.</p>
            <p>Service Discovery and Registry (Zookeeper / Consul / Eureka), easy request sending with client side load balancing (Feign + Ribbon), request proxying with Zuul. Everything is easy with Spring Cloud. Just add a dependency, a couple of lines of configuration and you’re ready to go.</p>
            <p>That’s fixing difficulties related to writing code - what about solving the complexity of debugging distributed systems? Log correlation and visualizing latency of parts of the system? Spring Cloud Sleuth to the rescue!</p>
            <p>In this presentation we’ll write a microserviced based system using the Spring Cloud tooling. We’ll focus on distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin.</p>
